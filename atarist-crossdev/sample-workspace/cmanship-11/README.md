# C-Manship chapter 11 Demo

Illustrative program taken from "C-Manship complete" by Clayton Walnut, thanks to the work of Lonny Pursell and DrCoolZic.

## How to use

**Refresh cmake build**, and also update compile_commands.json for clangd :

```
./cmrefresh.bash
```

**Compile into a program**, and copy it into `drive_c` folder :

```
./cmbuild.bash
```

**Run in Hatari**, and the desktop immediately starts the program :

```
./hatar-autorun.bash
```
